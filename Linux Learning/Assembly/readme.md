# Q. what is Reverse Engineering ? [Resource: GeeksforGeeks]
     Ans. Software Reverse Engineering is a process of recovering the design, 
          requirement specifications, and functions of a product from an analysis 
          of its code. It builds a program database and generates information from this. 
          Reverse engineering can extract design information from source code, but the abstraction level, 
          the completeness of the documentation, the degree to which tools and a human analyst work together,
          and the directionality of the process are highly variable.
