Q. what is Reverse Engineering ? [Resource: GeeksforGeeks]
Ans. Software Reverse Engineering is a process of recovering the design, 
     requirement specifications, and functions of a product from an analysis 
     of its code. It builds a program database and generates information from this. 

    The purpose of reverse engineering is to facilitate the maintenance work by improving
    the understandability of a system and producing the necessary documents for a legacy system. 

    Reverse engineering can extract design information from source code, but the abstraction level, 
    the completeness of the documentation, the degree to which tools and a human analyst work together,
     and the directionality of the process are highly variable.
